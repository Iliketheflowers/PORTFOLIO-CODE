           Welcome to my Portfolio :D <br>
            <br>
           I like observing things, noticing small details, 
           and sometimes overthinking why they caught my attention in the first place. <br>
           This portfolio is basically the result of that.
           <br><br>
           I follow moods, curiosity, and moments that make me stop and look twice. 
           If something feels interesting, awkward, or even slightly strange, 
           that's usually a good. You'll find my photography, film, and art here. 
           Sometimes it's about people, sometimes about vibes, 
           sometimes just a feeling I couldn't shake off. 
           <br><br>
           There isn't one big message, more like a collection of thoughts and moments 
           I didn't want to keep only to myself.
           <br><br>
           Feel free to scroll and indulge.
           Or don't.
    FREE WILL! <br>
    Either way... thanks for being here!

                                I photograph moments, places, animals, and people that I feel drawn to. Often it's
                                small details or situations that make me pause and look again. I work in an
                                observational way and let my intuition guide what I choose to photograph, rather
                                than planning images in advance.

                                I directed a documentary film about a drag queen in Berlin. The project grew out
                                of spending time together and building trust. My intention was to capture their
                                personality in a way that allows viewers to feel connected to the film.

                                I like to work with crosshatching and am drawn to darker themes. In this project, I
                                focused on animal skulls, using crosshatching to explore form, texture, and
                                contrast.
